# Function_python
Functions in python are declare by def func_name()
Calling of function are of two types:-
1. Call by Value
2. Call by Reference
These two are differentiate by the type of va;ues passed to them as parameters. The parameters passed to function are called actual parameters whereas the parameters received by function are called formal parameters.
Python Arguments is neither "pass by value" nor "pass by refrence", it based on "Pass by Object Refrence".
Depending on the type of object we pass in the function, the function behaves differently. Immutable objects show "pass by value" whereas mutable objects show "pass by reference".
Types of arguments
1. Arbitrary Arguments, *args (for tuple)
2. Arbitrary Keyword Arguments, **kwargs (for dictionary)
3. Default Parameter Value
4. Keyword Arguments
5. Positional-Only Arguments
6. Keyword-Only Arguments
7. Combine Positional-Only and Keyword-Only
